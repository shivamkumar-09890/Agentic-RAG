  "The concept of quantum entanglement involves particles that remain connected even when separated by large distances [Source: Introduction_to_Quantum_Physics.pdf (page 42)]. This phenomenon was famously described by Einstein as 'spooky action at a distance' [Source: Einstein_Biography.pdf (page 156)]."

  If the query cannot be answered using the provided information, respond with:
  "The information to answer this query is not available in the provided results."
